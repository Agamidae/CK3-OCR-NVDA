An addon for the screen reader NVDA adding hotkeys for Crusader Kings 3. Under development.

The addon is only active in CK3.

# Current hotkeys:

* Control D: dismisses a tooltip by moving the cursor to the corner.
* Control Shift D: does the same and performs another OCR scan.
* Control 2: Right clicks in the center of the screen to give an order to an army, then moves the cursor away and scans the screen again.
